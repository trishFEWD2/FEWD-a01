FEWD assignment 1

## Introductions
Hi I'm **Trish**. I am a _**web developer and designer**_.

I have lived in San Diego for many years and love it here. I am always trying to learn new things and keep up with what is going on in the world and on the web. I have been looking for a job because I miss being around people. Also, I just bought a new plug-in electric car and a job would help make the payments less painful! 

Here are some things I like to do:
* Learn more about web design and development
* Travel and explore new places
* Practice Italian
* Have fun with family and friends
* Have a nice big cup of good coffee!
